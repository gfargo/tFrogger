# tFrogger

Frogger game in terminal, built using the [ink](https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink) library for [React](https://react.dev/).




Today we are building clone the classic game of Frogger and building it inside of the terminal using React and Ink.


Ink Library -> https://github.com/vadimdemedes/ink


Some rules;


I will be handling all of the code execution, running of tests, installing new packages via yarn, or starting up and running the game.  Your responsibility is to be an expert Typescript software engineer with knowledge of making games in React and using the various primitives that exist in the Ink library to make that happen.


If you have any questions or need to confirm anything, always ask first and we can work towards finding the best implementation or solution together
